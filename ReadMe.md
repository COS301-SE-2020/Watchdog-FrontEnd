# Watchdog


### Project Description:

For the South African household who need an efficient way to ensure their safety and security the Watchdog system is a home security system that utilizes machine 
learning to identify an intruder and alert users and security companies on the potential breach. Unlike traditional surveillance systems that keep a backlog of 
redundant video storage our product utilizes machine learning and a modern cloud architecture to deliver a real-time security system.
